  For this project I was tasked with creating a vulnerability assessment report for a company called Artemis Financial.  Artemis FInancial is a consulting company that devolops individualized financial plans for their clients.  They create financial plans including savings, retirement, investments, and insurance plans.  As Artemis Financial continues to modernize their operatioins, they are interested in utilizing the most current and effective software security.  The cmompany has a RESTful web application and they wanted to seek advice on how to protect their organization from external threats. 
  
  I think I did a good job of articulating the software seccurity vulnerabilites of the application, as well as providing insight on how these vulnerabilities can be mitigated.
  
  Secure coding is very important because it ensures that the information being input or output from the application is not bein g altered in any way.  Secure coding is crucial for companies like Artemis Financial, where they would very likely face legal issues if they did not properly protect their client's data.  Aside from legal issues, companies like Artemis Financial would not be able to function without the trust of their clients and protecting client data is essential for maintaing trust.
